The central proposition underlying this proposal is that violence ensues when state legitimacy is compromised. When applied to post-conflict settings, it leads to the expectation that violence manifests where the legitimacy of constitutions and elections is undermined. Chapter 1 looks at how this expectation works in the constitution-writing process, and it argues that the exclusion of traditional leaders mediates the relationship between the democratic process and electoral quality by discouraging them from complying with the terms of the constitution. Chapter 2 explores the relationship between electoral quality and the severity of larger-scale violence, and it posits that lethality is conditioned on the interaction between pre- and post-electoral violence. Overall, this proposal highlights the significant role that violence plays in preventing the two tools in the peacebuilding toolkit -- constitutions and elections -- from advancing towards the two goals of democracy and peace.

However, the discussion thus far has centered on theories. To describe the gap between the theoretical utility of the peacebuilding instruments and the way they are used in practice, measurement tools must also incorporate the role of violence so that the level of non-violence, a common bottomline of democracy and peace, is not inflated. As the case studies of El Salvador and Guatemala demonstrate, even cases that are praised as `beacons of democracy' can remain shrouded in violence years after the supposed termination of a conflict. In El Salvador (Montoya 2018, 4), 

\begin{quote}
\small
``ordinary Salvadorans often described the postwar moment as one of ‘neither war nor peace’ or one even ‘worse than the war’ (Montoya 2007; Moodie 2010: 84). In invoking the war as a constant point of reference against which the present was assessed, such statements called into question the country’s transition to democracy.''
\end{quote}

Similarly, in Guatemala (Knowlton 2017, 140),

\begin{quote}
\small
``the state’s counterinsurgency violence [transformed] into a kind of state-supported violence in which government institutions act at the behest of national and transnational agribusinesses and mining companies to evict Q’eqchi’ from their traditional territories. In many cases the Guatemalan military and the National Civilian Police act as accomplices, accompanying and legitimizing evictions and acts of violence against Q’eqchi’ [a minority group in Guatemala] individuals and communities.''
\end{quote}

The aim of this chapter is to introduce the Post-Conflict Democracy Index (PCDI), an index that evaluates the meaningfulness of non-violence, taken as the degree to which violence and non-violence co-exists, in a country in a given year. PCDI achieves this goal by reconstituting the dimensions of violence and non-violence as necessary conditions of democracy so that it gives equal weight to both sides and reflects the balance between them in a given country over a given year.

The next section moves the discussion forward by outlining the issues inherent in existing democracy indices. Then, the third section follows by putting forward this chapter's proposed index, the PCDI, and explains how the index is constituted. The fourth section closes with some points on what more needs to be done to expand on and complete the chapter.

\section*{Measurement Issues: Polity and Varieties of Democracy}

 \subsection*{Polity}

The Polity index is the most widely used measure of democracy in the conflict literature. It contains a comprehensive set of data on 195 countries from 1800 to 2016, and grounds its conceptual basis in Harry Eckstein and Ted Robert Gurr's (1975) \emph{Patterns of Authority}, which characterizes democracies and autocracies as ``distinct patterns of authority'' (Marshall, Gurr and Jaggers 2017, 17). Despite its original intent, scholars often derive an overall Polty score by subtracting the computed autocracy (AUTOC) scores from the democracy (DEMOC) scores. This move transforms the Polity score into an interval variable (ranging from -10 to 10), which gives rise to issues that are compounded by the measure's inherent conceptualization, measurement and aggregation problems (for a critique of Polity and other democracy indices, see Boese 2019; Treir and Jackman 2008; Vreeland 2008; Munck and Verkuilen 2002). In the list of weaknesses, three are critical to limiting the suitability of Polity as a measure of democracy in post-conflict settings.

First, Polity has, as a part of its scoring criteria, aspects that capture civil conflict. For instance, in the guidelines for coding the sub-dimensions of a regime's regulation (PARREG) and competitiveness (PARCOMP) of participation, Marshall et al (2017, 75) state that ``[a] polity is coded [as an instance of factional competition] if democratic elections are held in an environment of persistent and widespread civil unrest (rebellion, revolution, and/or ethnic conflict).'' Likewise, when coding whether polities are undergoing ``persistent overt coercion'', Marshall et al (2017, 77) write that ``[a] polity is coded here if elections are deemed to be “unfair” because \dots democratic elections are held in an environment of a persistent, yet largely ineffective or waning, civil violence or ethnic conflict.''

Conceptually, since civil conflict does not reveal the nature of a state's regime by definition, its inclusion as a coding criterion merely adds an irrelevant dimension into the measurement. More importantly, for conflict scholars, this addition hinders an empirical study of the relationship between conflict and regime. Since these coding rules confine conflict states to the middle of the Polity scores, some scholars contest that the consistent correlation between anocracies and violence, or the so-called murder in the middle, is in fact an artefact of such coding decisions (Boese 2019; Vreeland 2008). 

Second, due to Polity's weighting and aggregation decisions, substantive interpretations can be hampered because a wide variation of countries can be grouped within one regime score (Boese 2019; Trier and Jackman 2008; Munck and Verkuilen 2002). Three dimensions, namely, executive recruitment; executive constraints; and political competition, make up each regime type in the Polity project. Each of these dimensions, in turn, comprises a different number of sub-dimensions and their nominal categories. To compute the final democracy and autocracy scores, the Polity project sums up the sub-dimensions along with the weights that are assigned to the majority of these nominal categories.

Figure~\ref{fig1} summarizes the subdimensions, the categories and the scale weights. These weights are an issue to those who seek to glean substantive interpretations from a given Polity score. When both the sub-dimensions and the weights are simply aggregated through summation, every point carried by these weights become valued at the same level as the sub-dimensions. Yet, because the coding manual neither explains the rationale for the weight assignment nor provides a justification for the assigned values, there is no clear way to make sense of the substantive meaning of a final score. 

Still more, because these weights increase the number of configurations that can make up the final score, each given level along the Polity index thus comprises a great range of polities. The result is a coarsening of the information which each Polity score conveys. Considering these limitations, Polity is therefore unsuitable for capturing post-conflict democracy since fine differences matter in differentiating among complex political environments and in informing policy makers on important issues of resource allocation.

\end{figure}

Third and finally, Polity is an inadequate measure of post-conflict democracy because it largely omits an important dimension of democracy, that is, participation (Boese 2019; Munck and Verkuilen 2002). According to the coding manual, participation is operationalized in two ways. The first is ``regulation of participation'', which identifies the extent to which ``there are binding rules on when, whether, and how political preferences are expressed.'' Countries are assigned to different nominal categories based on the extent of factionalism and the degree to which groups are excluded from political involvement (Marshall et al. 2017, 26). The second is ``competitiveness of participation'', which specifies the extent to which diverse opinions are tolerated. Countries are classified under less competitive categories if states and political parties act on repression, exclusion or parochialism (Marshall et al. 2017, 26-7).

These coding rules make clear that what is really coded in Polity is exclusion and tolerance, and not participation, which is taken by democracy scholars to mean the extent of inclusion or the degree to which citizens may hold politicians accountable (Held 2006; Dahl 1998). The ability to measure inclusion rather than exclusion is particularly crucial for measuring post-conflict democracy. Conflicts oftentimes break out because of exclusive politics; hence, the design of such institutions (e.g. political systems, electoral designs, and constitutions) that influence the extent of inclusivity is a huge matter of contention in post-conflict politics. Absent the ability to pick up on such changes, Polity leaves out an important assessor of post-conflict democracy.
% Other issues with polity: Nominal; Equal weighting (problem of equivalence); Redundancy due to lack of clarity in the levels of abstraction/dimensions; Substantive interpretations of the 0 category

\subsection*{Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) and the Problem with the Latent Variable Approach}

An improved alternative to Polity is the Electoral Democracy Index (EDI), an index generated from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project. It measures the extent to which a country resembles an ideal electoral democracy, which is defined in accordance with Robert Dahl's (1998) conceptualization of polyarchy. According to Dahl, a polyarchy has six necessary political institutions: (1) elected officials; (2) free, fair, and frequent elections; (3) freedom of expression; (4) alternative sources of information; (5) associational autonomy; and (6) inclusive citizenship. EDI collapses the third and the fourth dimensions into one, and thus, is constituted by a total of five attributes.

Out of the existing democracy indices, the EDI receives a particularly high praise because its measurement is built upon a clear definition; its aggregation rule is clearly outlined and justified; inter-coder reliability is well taken into account; and its use of Bayesian updating allows the index to capture new information that may vary over time (Boese 2019). For the purpose of this project, these improvements are particularly crucial because they resolve some of the issues that constrain Polity's suitability as a measure of post-conflict democracy. Unnecessary variables like civil conflict are left outside of EDI's measurement, and both dimensions -- competition and participation -- are clearly represented. Moreover, because V-Dem's aggregation rules are well-specified, every unit change along the interval is substantively meaningful and interpretation becomes less of an issue.

However, for all its advantages, an issue remains with the use of the latent variable approach in the construction of the EDI. The latent variable approach is oftentimes chosen for its ability to simulate uncertainty and weigh indicators using a data-driven process (Smith and Spaniel 2020; Treir and Jackman 2008). Accounting for uncertainty, and hence, measurement error, is particularly important when the latent variable is to be used as an independent variable because statistical models do not consider errors on the left hand side of the model. A consequence of such omission is the potential biasing of parameter estimates, which in turn, lead scholars to arrive at the wrong conclusions (Trier and Jackman 2008). The simulation of uncertainty, furthermore, allows scholars to quantify the level of confidence which prevents conclusions from being over-stated. Separately, the data-driven approach to estimating indicator weights can also be advantageous because it replaces the need to assign arbitrary weights and instead lets the data reveal relationships that exist within themselves. These benefits notwithstanding, the latent variable approach is inappropriate when the variable at hand is one with non-compensatory dimensions (Wuttke, Schimpf and Schoen 2020).

A reason for the incompatibility between the latent variable approach and necessary conditions is due to the aggregation rule -- averaging -- that is typical of the method. The final outcome is a weighted average of all the indicators, which in the EDI, occurs at the level of aggregation from the indicator level to the conceptual attributes. The sole exception is the dimension of inclusive citizenship, which includes only the extent of suffrage. An implication of applying averages is that higher scores on one indicator can be used to compensate for lower scores on the others because it is the mean value that determines the final score (Goertz 2020; Wuttke, Schimpf and Schoen 2020). This effect of substitutability among indicators leads to concept-measure inconsistency when dimensions are conceptualized as necessary conditions because indicators are not supposed to be substitutable. In other words, a unit should drop out as an instance of the overall concept as soon as it fails to fulfil at least one of the necessary dimensions. When it comes to analyzing post-conflict democracy, the key constitutive and non-substitutable dimension is non-violence.

The bases for asserting non-violence as a necessary attribute of democracy rest on both conceptual and theoretical grounds. I elaborate on Dahl's conceptualization of democracy here to stay consistent with V-Dem's conceptual basis. Dahl (1998, 49) insists that a democracy may only be considered as such if it guarantees rights to its citizens \emph{and} effectively acts to enforce such rights. Rights are central because they grant individuals various forms of freedoms and allow individuals to ``participate fully in determining the conduct of the government'' or defend oneself from a government's abuse (Dahl 1998, 52). Crucially, the democratic tools or institutions that facilitate the exercise of such rights must as such be non-violent; otherwise, the conceptual bases of democracy, such as free and fair elections, cannot be ``free'' (Peh and Goertz 2020; Norris 2014; Schedler 2003; Elklit and Svensson 1997; Schmitter and Karl 1991). Hence, non-violence has to be treated as a necessary dimension for any efforts at conceptualizing or measuring democracy to be complete.

The language used within the peacebuilding circle also evidences the expectation of a theoretical relationship between democracy and peace. In the words of Boutros Boutros-Ghali (1996, 8), a former Secretary-General of the UN, ``Democracy within States ... fosters the evolution of the social contract upon which lasting peace can be built.'' Furthermore, some scholars maintain that because democracy and its tools ``provide insitutional mechanisms and legitimacy,'' it is a necessary condition ``without which peace building in a post-war state may not materialize (Joshi 2010, 829).'' Ergo, there exists an assumption that democracy has the potential to cause or promote peace. For democracy to exert such causal powers, conceptualizations of democracy must contain the attributes that are capable of motivating peace (see Goertz 2006); insofar as the non-violence aspect of democracy has the potential to be one such attribute, it must be built in as a constitutive component of democracy (see Goertz 2006).
%Most scholars would agree that democracy is a non-violent means of governance, either by definition or when compared with other forms of governance, at least in intra-state settings (Coppedge et al. 2020; Norris 2014; Davenport 2007; 1997; Diamond 2002; Linz and Stepan 1996; Schmitter and Karl 1991).

What is frequently left unsaid in either the democracy or the conflict literature is the relationship between violence and non-violence (see Campbell, Findley and Kikuta 2017 for an exception). When weighted averages are used, high levels of non-violence are allowed to make up for the presence of varying degrees of violence. Yet, one would hesitate to agree that a country is in a state of non-violence even if the levels of violence is somewhat moderate. Here, I draw on two examples, electoral violence in the Republic of Congo (ROC) and Ivory Coast, to show how EDI levels may show little to no change despite extensive electoral violence. Figure~\ref{fig2} shows the EDI levels of these countries over time. According to Dorina Bekoe (2012, 7),

\begin{quote}
\small
[In ROC,] Even after the election was rerun in November 1993 ... violence ensured. As many as 2,000 people were killed during November 1993 to January 1994 (U.S. State Dept. 1995; United Nations 1997) ... [Four years later, in May 1997, during] the six months of violence until [the leader of an opposition coalition, Denis] Sassou-Nguesso seized the presidential palace, about 15,000 died (Bazenguissa-Gangaa 1999, 39-42; De Beer and Cornwell 1999). Over the next two years, 20,000 more lives were lost (Polity IV 2010). Likewise, the four months of postelection violence in Côte d'Ivoire [Ivory Coast] in 2010 and 2011 broke down along the same ethnic lines and issues that caused the civil war in 2002. Many feared that ... Côte d'Ivoire would return to full-blown war. Even so, wth some three thousand dead and one million displaced ... one may argue that civil war war returned to Côte d'Ivoire in 2011.

\end{figure}

A comparison between Bekoe's (2012) description of the situations in ROC and Ivory Coast and the trends in figure~\ref{fig2} evidences a limitation of using weighted averages. In 1993 (the first dashed line), ROC's EDI fell by an insignificant amount and the country's level of democracy hovered at around the level of 0.43 until the next major episode of violence in 1997 (the second dashed line). Worse still, Ivory Coast's level of democracy sustained an upward trend from 0.48 in 2010 (black line) despite the war-like conditions in the aftermath of the country's election. Thus, by adopting the latent variable approach, EDI falls short when accounting for the balance between violence and non-violence.

Conceptually, violence that takes place during electoral cycles should impose especially huge penalities on a country's democracy score because free and fair elections, as mentioned above, are fundamental to the functioning and the conceptualization of democracy. Pragmatically, the difference between de jure and de facto elections also most often form the foundation by which scholars differentiate between democratic and non-democratic regimes (Luhrmann et al 2018; O'Donnell 1996; Schumpeter 1976[2003]). Hence, for non-violence to be taken seriously, the occurrence of violence has to compromise country's democracy levels, especially if it pervades democratic institutions. In this way, only countries which succeed in pursuing meaningful or quality non-violence may be identified as clear members of democratic progress. In the next section, I show how the EDI can be reconstituted to meet the purpose of measuring post-conflict democracy.

\section*{Constructing the Post-Conflict Democracy Index (PCDI)}

This section introduces the Post-Conflict Democracy Index (PCDI), a measurement tool that facilitates assessments on a country's democracy levels in post-conflict settings. As the preceding discussion shows, democracy and especially its aspect of non-violence are highly valued by peacebuilding scholars and practitioners. However, existing democracy measures are either inappropriate or fall short of capturing the quality of non-violence. The PCDI addresses the shortfalls by building upon V-Dem's EDI and changing, specifically, its aggregation rule.

Figure~\ref{fig3} shows the conceptualization of PCDI. The five dimensions at the second level of the figure represent the five institutions that compose democracy, as defined by the V-Dem project. Except for suffrage, all dimensions are constituted by a variety of indicators, which in V-Dem's methodology, are weighted using the Bayesian factor analysis and then averaged to compute a single index score for each country in a given year. Rather than weighted averages, the PCDI first separates the indicators for three of the dimensions, namely, clean elections index, freedom of association, and freedom of expression, into violence and non-violence.

Sticking to the conventions of conflict studies, violence refers to direct violence (Galtung 1967), which means, the threat or actual use of force. Figure~\ref{fig3} illustrates this separation at a level below the dimensions level. Although the figure depicts such separation only for the clean elections index, the same procedure applies to all three attributes that have their boxes marked in red. The elected officials index is left out of this step because the indicators constituting this dimension do not embody characteristics of violence or nonviolence. Conversely, the three dimensions that are marked in red make up a common theme, and that is, ``meaningful'' elections (Coppedge et al. 2020, 31; Diamond 2002) or elections that promote political participation and that are free from any form of physical coercion or manipulation (Schedler 2002; Schmitter and Karl 1991).

\begin{figure} [h!]
\caption{PCDI Concept Figure}

\begin{center}

{\footnotesize Dashed line: Constitutive relationship}

{\footnotesize Arrow: Indicator relationship}

{\footnotesize * : Logical AND}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

At the lowest level of figure~\ref{fig3} lies the indicator level. Due to the relatively numerous indicators that compose each dimension, all indicators are represented by \emph{I}. In PCDI, as shown in the figure, these indicators are summed because the highest level of violence or non-violence is what reveals the extent of each dimension. To note, PCDI follows V-Dem's coding on all the indicators. For instance, acts of intimidation by the state during elections are coded between 0 and 4 where 0 indicates high levels of repression and 4 indicates none at all (Coppedge et al. 2019, 57-8). Hence, the so-called highest level of violence has instead the lowest integer. This coding decision makes sense because all indicators would point in a uniform direction: higher values lead to higher levels of democracy.

What differs more between PCDI and EDI is the aggregation method at this level. In PCDI, the sums of both violence and non-violence indicators are multiplied. This logic gives both dimensions equal weighting, which follows from the foregoing discussion on the quality of non-violence. In fact, without the intentional elevation of both dimensions, the effect of violence would likely be attenuated since the number of violent indicators is fewer than the non-violent ones across all three relevant conceptual attributes (see the Appendix on the list of indicators).

Finally, multiplication is used to aggregate from the attribute to the conceptual level. The use of multiplication coheres with Dahl's (1998) argument that each of the institutions is a necessary condition of democracy. The conjoinment of all institutions also ensures that the levels of competition and participation in a country are meaningful, and that elections are occurring in a supportive environment, which makes them more than an institutional facade (Coppedge et al. 2020; Norris 2014; Diamond 2002; Schedler 2002; Linz and Stepan 1996; Karl and Schmitter 1991). The logic of multiplication is suitable for aggregating necessary conditions because they are non-substitutable (Goertz 2020); scoring a 0 on any one criterion effectively makes the unit an irrelevant example for the concept at hand.

Figure~\ref{fig4} illustrates a semantic transformation of the PCDI that is aggregated to show democracy levels in post-conflict settings. The Y-axis represents the degree of membership of a case in relation to the concept of democracy. At the level of 0.0, a case is no where close to resembling a democracy and at the 1.0 level, a case becomes a quintessential example. The X-axis represents a scaled continuum of the levels of democracy following the PCDI from 0 to 1. A notable outcome of elevating the violence and non-violence dimensions in the PCDI is that one can now imagine that countries which act on greater levels of violence would fall closer to 0 while those that act more non-violently will congregate closer to 1 along the continuum.

\section*{Conclusion}

This chapter has surveyed the popular democracy indices that are used in the conflict, and particularly, the peacebuilding literature. More importantly, it builds on the shortfalls of these indices and introduces the Post-Conflict Democracy Index, which seeks to overcome existing limitations and meet the purposes of peacebuilding scholars and practitioners. The biggest contribution of the PCDI is perhaps its deliberate accounting of the meaningfulness of non-violence, which is highlighted as a central theme throughout this proposal.

However, more work needs to be done to better specify the index and establish its utility. Therefore, some next steps include the actual construction of the index and comparing it with V-Dem's Electoral Democracy Index to evaluate whether the proposed index indeed enhances our understanding of democracy in post-conflict contexts.
